# API Request Project

### Use Fetch to Access and Parse Data
For this project, I used the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to gather and generate sample employee data to a webpage. I utilized the `fetch` API in JavaScript to submit a request for data from the server and then handled that data all in JavaScript.

### Search Feature
The search box will display only employees that match the search results. This happens as the user types, but there is a search button as well.

### Overlay navigation
Once a user is clicked, an overlay appears with more data on that user. A 'close' button exits the overlay and navigation buttons allow you to move to the next or previous entry displayed on the webpage. If you navigate previous from the first entry, you are taken to the last entry. If you navigate next from the last entry, you are taken to the first entry.

### Custom CSS and Styling
The modal window that pops up initially had styling that had a `previous` and `next` button below the modal. I changed these to be left and right arrrows (utilizing [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)) in order to consolidate space and have a more modern look.
